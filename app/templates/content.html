            <h1>Cybersecurity Handbook</h1>
            <h2 id="importance">Importance of Cybersecurity Awareness</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges facing organizations today. As state employees, we have a special responsibility to protect the sensitive data of our citizens and to ensure the continuous operation of critical state infrastructure and services. The Local Government Cybersecurity Act (F.S. 282.3185) mandates compliance with cybersecurity standards and reporting requirements highlighting the importance of our role in maintaining cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Cyber-attacks can have severe consequences including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data breaches that expose sensitive citizen information</li>
                <li>Disruption of essential state services</li>
                <li>Financial losses from theft or ransom payments</li>
                <li>Damage to the state's reputation and public trust.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By raising awareness about cybersecurity threats and best practices, we can create a culture of cybersecurity throughout the state workforce. An informed and vigilant workforce is our best defense against cyber threats.</p>
            <h2>Objectives of the Handbook</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide a clear, accessible introduction to cybersecurity concepts and terminology.</li>
                <li>Raise awareness about common cyber threats and how to recognize them.</li>
                <li>Clarify every employee's role and responsibility in maintaining cybersecurity.</li>
                <li>Offer practical guidance for preventing, detecting, and reporting cyber incidents.</li>
                <li>Serve as a quick reference guide during a suspected cyber-attack.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By the end of this handbook, you will have a solid foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals and will know what steps to take to protect yourself and our state from cyber threats.</p>

            <h2 id="cybersecurity">Understanding Cybersecurity</h2>
            <h3>What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Effective cybersecurity reduces the risk of cyber-attacks and protects organizations and individuals from the unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.</p>
            <p>The Local Government Cybersecurity Act (F.S. 282.3185) provides a legal framework for local governments to follow, ensuring that all cybersecurity measures meet minimum standards and best practices such as those outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.</p>
            <h3>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h3>
            <p>In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyber defense programs. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.</p>
            <p>For businesses and government organizations, cybersecurity threats can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theft of intellectual property, business plans, and sensitive employee/citizen data</li>
                <li>Disruption to operations or destruction of data</li>
                <li>Financial losses and costs associated with remediation and reputational damage</li>
                <li>Legal liabilities and regulatory fines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cybersecurity is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences.</p>
            <h3>Basic Terminologies Explained</h3>
            <p><strong>Malware:</strong> Software designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or network. This includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.</p>
            <p><strong>Phishing:</strong> A type of social engineering where an attacker sends fraudulent messages to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information or deploying malicious software on their infrastructure.</p>
            <p><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Malware that encrypts a victim's files and the attacker demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. It's a type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access.</p>
            <p><strong>Firewall:</strong> A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Encryption:</strong> The process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.</p>
            <p><strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong> A service that lets you access the internet privately and securely by routing your connection through a server and hiding your online actions.</p>
