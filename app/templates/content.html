                    <h1>Welcome to the Cybersecurity Handbook</h1>

                    <h2>Objectives of the Handbook</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide a clear, accessible introduction to cybersecurity concepts and terminology.</li>
                        <li>Raise awareness about common cyber threats and how to recognize them.</li>
                        <li>Clarify every employee's role and responsibility in maintaining cybersecurity.</li>
                        <li>Offer practical guidance for preventing, detecting, and reporting cyber incidents.</li>
                        <li>Serve as a quick reference guide during a suspected cyber-attack.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
<p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Effective cybersecurity reduces the risk of cyber-attacks and protects organizations and individuals from the unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.</p>
<p>The Local Government Cybersecurity Act (F.S. 282.3185) provides a legal framework for local governments to follow, ensuring that all cybersecurity measures meet minimum standards and best practices, such as those outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.</p>
<h2>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
<p>In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyber defense programs. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.</p>
<p>For businesses and government organizations, cybersecurity threats can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theft of intellectual property, business plans, and sensitive employee/citizen data</li>
<li>Disruption to operations or destruction of data</li>
<li>Financial losses and costs associated with remediation and reputational damage</li>
<li>Legal liabilities and regulatory fines</li>
</ul>
<p>Cybersecurity is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences.</p>
<h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017):</strong> This worldwide cyberattack affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.</li>
<li><strong>Equifax Data Breach (2017):</strong> Equifax, one of the largest credit bureaus in the U.S., suffered a breach that exposed about 147.9 million consumers. The attackers accessed information including Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases driver's license numbers.</li>
<li><strong>SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020):</strong> Russian hackers compromised the infrastructure of SolarWinds, a company that produces a network and applications monitoring platform called Orion, and then used that access to produce and distribute trojanized updates to the software's users, including several U.S. federal agencies.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Your Role in Cybersecurity</h2>
<h3>Every Employee's Responsibility</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the IT department or the security team. Every employee, regardless of their role, has a part to play in keeping our organization secure. Here are some key responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of potential threats and how to recognize them.</li>
<li>Follow security policies and procedures.</li>
<li>Protect sensitive data and systems access.</li>
<li>Report any suspected security incidents promptly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Local Government Cybersecurity Act mandates that all local government employees with access to the local governmentâ€™s network complete basic cybersecurity training within 30 days of starting their employment and annually thereafter. For technology professionals and employees with access to highly sensitive information, advanced cybersecurity training is required within 30 days of starting and annually thereafter.</p>
<h2>Importance of Vigilance</h2>
<p>Vigilance is key to preventing cyber incidents. Here are some ways to stay vigilant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments, even if they appear to be from a trusted source.</li>
<li>Be wary of unsolicited or unexpected emails, especially those requesting sensitive information.</li>
<li>Double-check the authenticity of a website before entering login credentials or sensitive data.</li>
<li>Keep an eye out for signs of a potential breach, such as system slowdowns or suspicious activity.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cybersecurity Incident Severity Levels</h2>
<p>The level of severity of the cybersecurity incident is defined by the National Cyber Incident Response Plan of the United States Department of Homeland Security as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 5:</strong> An emergency-level incident within the specified jurisdiction that poses an imminent threat to the provision of wide-scale critical infrastructure services; national, state, or local government security; or the lives of the country's, state's, or local government's residents.</li>
<li><strong>Level 4:</strong> A severe-level incident that is likely to result in a significant impact in the affected jurisdiction to public health or safety; national, state, or local security; economic security; or civil liberties.</li>
<li><strong>Level 3:</strong> A high-level incident that is likely to result in a demonstrable impact in the affected jurisdiction to public health or safety; national, state, or local security; economic security; civil liberties; or public confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Level 2:</strong> A medium-level incident that may impact public health or safety; national, state, or local security; economic security; civil liberties; or public confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Level 1:</strong> A low-level incident that is unlikely to impact public health or safety; national, state, or local security; economic security; civil liberties; or public confidence.</li>
</ul>
