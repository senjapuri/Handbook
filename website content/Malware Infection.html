<h2>How Malware Infections Happen</h2>
<p>Malware, short for malicious software, is designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Malware can infect systems through various means, including phishing emails, malicious websites, infected USB drives, and vulnerabilities in software. Once installed, malware can steal sensitive data, encrypt files for ransom, or allow attackers to control the system remotely.</p>
